import random

# 1. Create a list of rock, paper, scissors in a variable called rps.
# "rps" means rock, paper, scissors
rps = ['rock','paper','scissors']

# 2. Create a variable called user_choice that takes input from the user and stores it.
#   Make sure the user enters rock, paper, or scissors.
while True:
  user_choice = input("Enter rock, paper or scissors: ")# fix this, user input, hint: use input("...")
  if user_choice not in rps:
    print("Invalid choice, choose only 'rock', 'paper' or 'scissors'")
  else:
    break

# 3. Create a variable called computer_choice that randomly chooses from rps.
computer_choice = random.choice(rps) # fix this, random choice from rps

# 4. Print out the user_choice and the computer_choice.
print("You chose: " + user_choice)
print("The computer chose: " + computer_choice)

# 5. Print out the winner of rock, paper, scissors.
# continue this if statement to print out the winner
if user_choice == computer_choice:
  print("It's a tie!")
elif (user_choice == 'rock' and computer_choice == 'scissors') or (user_choice == 'paper' and computer_choice == 'rock') or (user_choice == 'scissors' and computer_choice == 'paper'):
  print ("You Win!")
else:
  print ("You Lose!")

# rock beats scissors

# Example of an if statement:
# math = input("What is 2 + 2? ")
# if math == "4":
#   print("You are correct!")
# elif math == "3":
#   print("You are close!")
# else:
